      <h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
      <p>One of the first things that caught my attention was the fluidity of the scrolling animations on the site. Unlike many other websites, where scrolling can often feel abrupt or poorly executed, this site employs carefully designed curves that enhance the overall smoothness of the experience. This thoughtful approach to animation not only improves usability but also creates a more visually appealing interaction.</p>

      <h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I started by exploring some interesting websites through RMIT Canvas modules. Each website offered a unique experience. On Myoung Ae Kim's site, the website offeres a unique perspective on web design through the lens of an artist. I scrolled through Brooomstick and Downstream to see how they utilized animation and interaction. And then I stopped by https://gehry.getty.edu/, smooth animation caught my attention, so I decided to discover more.</li>
        <li>I clicked anywhere on the website to listen to the soundscape.</li>
        <li>I scrolled through the pages, immersing myself in the content.</li>
        <li>I clicked the menu navigation to understand the website's structure.</li>
        <li>I hovered over different elements, captivated by the interactive animations.</li>
        <li>Reaching the bottom of the page, I discovered the talented web development team behind the creation. I then searched for them on Google to learn more about their work. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-3-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
      <p>Scrolling through this website is an incredibly smooth and satisfying experience. The seamless animations that accompany the scrolling motion are truly impressive. Whether I moved at a leisurely pace or sped through the content, the transitions were consistently smooth, creating a delightful user experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-4-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
      <p>A smooth user experience is crucial for any website. While scrolling through this site, I found the overall interaction to be pleasant. However, the extensive use of curved animations introduced a level of visual complexity that occasionally felt overwhelming.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-5-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
      <p>The .edu domain immediately indicated an academic or educational focus for the website. As I explored, it became clear that the site is dedicated to the innovative architecture of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The website effectively guides users through the design process in a chapter-like format. Its presentation style strongly resembles an interactive infographic, gradually unveiling more information as I scrolled through the pages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-6-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
      <p>The website has done a very good job in creating a digital archive dedicated to Frank Gehry's iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall. Each chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the building's design process and its profound architectural significance. Offering unique insights into Gehry's design methodology, including his innovative use of physical and digital models, the exhibition is a comprehensive resource. Featuring new interviews with Gehry himself and groundbreaking scholarship, this digital experience offers an unparalleled immersion into the architect's groundbreaking work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-7-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
      <p>As previously mentioned, the website's consistent use of curved animations across elements created a visually complex and somewhat distracting environment. However, deeper exploration revealed increasingly interactive features. Each chapter offered a detailed breakdown of the concert hall's construction process. The ability to interact with 3D models of both the exterior and interior provided comprehensive insights.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-8-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?n</h2>
      <p>The exhibition effectively generates a sense of intrigue, encouraging visitors to delve deeper into the project. However, the depth of engagement ultimately depends on the individual viewer's interests and available time. The website provides a solid overview of Gehry's work at first glance, but those seeking a more in-depth understanding of this architectural innovation will find ample opportunity to explore.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-9-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
      <p>The website's design strongly resembles a high-end magazine, with its thoughtful typography and layout. It offers a rich multimedia experience, including interview videos featuring Frank Gehry, a gallery of images showcasing concept sketches and real-life photographs, and interactive 3D models of the building concepts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-10-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
      <p>I should act this as a piece of information about specific aspects since this website serves as a comprehensive resource detailing the construction process of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Each element, from text to visuals, provides granular information about the building's development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-11-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
      <p>When I first visited this website, I felt a surge of curiosity, captivated by the intricate design of the concert hall. The more I explored, the more I discovered the building's unique structure, characterized by its abstract shapes. The combination of images, videos, and 3D models provided an engaging insight into the thoughtful design process behind the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Each interaction deepened my appreciation for the architectural artistry involved in its creation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-12-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>
      <h2>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
      <p>While I appreciate the smooth scrolling experience of the website, the excessive use of animations across many elements creates a sense of visual complexity that can be overwhelming. It often draws my attention away from the content. I believe it would be more effective if the animations were concentrated on the key components of the site, such as headings, titles, and media. This focused approach would enhance the overall user experience and allow for a more seamless interaction with the content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container question-13-animation">
      <button class="close-btn"><i class="fa fa-close"></i></button>  
      <h2>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
      <p>Overall, I found the website to be exceptionally well-designed. I particularly love the layout, which seamlessly integrates interactive elements such as 3D models, images, and videos. The smooth scrolling experience further enhances this design, creating a harmonious blend that fosters both fun and curiosity. This thoughtful combination makes for an engaging and enjoyable user experience.</p>
