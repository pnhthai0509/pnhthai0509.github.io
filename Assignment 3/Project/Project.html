  <!-- This project page will showcase all of my previous work, featuring five projects included in this portfolio. My target audience consists of those seeking VFX artists, cinematographers, and video editors; therefore, all the works featured here focus on video and visual effects. While I also have graphic design and photography projects that I enjoy, they are not my primary focus at this time, so I chose not to include them in this portfolio. -->

  <!-- For the design, I drew inspiration from the horizontal image gallery on the Stone Island store website (https://www.stoneisland.com/en-gb/). However, I prefer galleries that allow for user interaction rather than automatic scrolling. As a result, I designed it to be scrollable vertically, while the image gallery itself scrolls horizontally. -->

              <!-- As I mentioned earlier, I am using Dropbox as a CDN. Since Dropbox offers only 2GB of free storage, I will primarily use it for large media assets like videos and GIFs. Cloudinary provides 5GB of free storage but has limits on file types, so I decided to give it a try based on numerous recommendations. I plan to use Cloudinary mainly for images.

              One reason I opted for a CDN for images instead of uploading them to a web server, as I did in Assignment 2, is that I encountered an error while hosting this website through GoDaddy, which stated that the images could not load. Despite trying various solutions—such as changing the file type from PNG to JPEG and reducing file sizes—I was unable to resolve the issue. Therefore, using a CDN for images became a more reliable choice.  -->
